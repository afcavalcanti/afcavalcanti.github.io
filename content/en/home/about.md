Hi! My name is Andr√© Cavalcanti, I'm a scientist and mechanical engineer. I created this website as an online portfolio to tell a little about myself and resume the projects I have worked on. 

My father and grandfather were automotive mechanics, so I grew up in a mechanic's shop. I was never in love with cars but always enjoyed seeing how things fit and worked together. I always tried to understand how my toys worked and how I could improve them. I remember that every year in the rainy season I bought polystyrene and made a boat, dismantled some remote control cars, took out dc motors and put them in the boat, they never went forward because I never made a rudder. I always knew what say when they asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. 

In 2013 I was champion of IEEE Very Small Size at Brazilian Robotics Competition, today I'm graduated from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte with a degree in Science and Technology and in Mechanical Engineering, interested in developing my knowledge along with mechatronics, automation and IoT.
